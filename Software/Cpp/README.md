# GrovePi C++ library

This library provides the basic functions for using the GrovePi in C++.
See more about the GrovePi here:  https://www.nuget.org/packages/GrovePi/

### To install package:
First of all, you have to `cd` to `../GrovePi/Software/Cpp`
```
$ tar -xzvf grovepicpp_0.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd grovepicpp_0.1.1
$ sudo dpkg --install ./grovepicpp_0.1.1.deb
```

The package contains the following sources:
* grovepi.cpp
* grove_dht_pro.cpp
* grove_rgb_lcd.cpp

### To uninstall package:
```
$ sudo dpkg --remove grovepicpp
```

### To compile with package installed:
```
g++ -Wall [dependencies[,..]].cpp -lgrovepicpp -o [program_name].out// the general format
```
```
g++ -Wall grove_relay.cpp -lgrovepicpp -o grove_relay.out // a trivial example
```

### To compile without package:
```
g++ -Wall grovepi.cpp [dependencies[,..]].cpp -o [program_name].out // the general format
```
```
g++ -Wall grovepi.cpp grove_relay.cpp -o grove_relay.out // a trivial example
```

### Then run the executable:
```
$ ./[program_name].out
```

# The basic library functionalities of GrovePi are:
* `initGrovePi()` : function for initializing communication w/ the GrovePi. It uses the implicit address of `0x04`
* `initDevice(uint8_t address)` : function for initializing communication with a device at a specific `address`
* `delay(milliseconds`) : function for delaying given milliseconds
* `pinMode(uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode)`: function for setting a digital/analog port accordingly. `mode` = `INPUT` / `OUTPUT`
* `digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, bool value)` : function for writing `HIGH`/`LOW` values to a digital port
* `digitalRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for returning the digital value (either `HIGH`/`LOW`) read on the given pin
* `analogWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value)` : function for writing an analog value from 0-255 to a given pin
* `analogRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for reading the value on a given pin and which returns a value from 0-255
* `ultrasonicRead(uint8_t pin)` : function for returning the distance in centimeters an ultrasonic sensor reads on a given digital port pin
* `setMaxI2CRetries(int _max_i2c_retries)` : function for setting the maximum number of retries before quitting current operation - **you should not use it**
* `setGrovePiAddress(uint8_t addr)` : change the implicit GrovePi address -> this doesn't change the GrovePi's address (firmware-wise & physically), but it's only setting the address at which GrovePi is reachable - **you should not use it**
* `writeBlock(uint8_t command, uint8_t pin_number, uint8_t opt1 = 0, uint8_t opt2 = 0)` : function for issuing a command to the GrovePi. The command is targeting a certain pin. The optional arguments can be anything depending on the command. (for example for analogWriting, we would use opt1 for sending the value we want to write)
* `writeByte(uint8_t byte_val)` : it only sends a byte to the GrovePi. You can compose the `writeBlock` function by using multiple calls of this function
* `readBlock(uint8_t *data_block)` : returns via the pointer the read data from GrovePi. The length of the array is returned by the function
* `readByte()` : returns a byte from GrovePi

# Attention:
* it's currently not supported to use multiple I2C devices with this library, unless you reinitialize communication with the device you want to talk to (w/ `initgrovePi()` or `initDevice(uint8_t address)`
* for any of the given functions in this library, if an error occurs on the I2C line, a `GrovePi::I2CError()` is thrown. `GrovePi::I2CError()` is derived from `std::runtime_error`
* the library is included in `GrovePi` namespace, so don't forget to use the resolution operator or the `using` command.


# How to create a deb package:

Extract the `tar package` and `cd` into its directory. The folders' hierarchy is this.


![archive folder structure](tar_archive.PNG)


----------


You'll see that in the `source` folder there are the source files along with the `.o` object files and `.so` files (which are the shared libraries).

In order to generate the **shared libraries** we need to follow the next steps
### **Step 1**
 Compile all the `.cpp`  files into position independent code (object files) which are required for creating a shared library:

    g++ -C -Wall -Werror -fpic [cppfile]
Run the following command to create a shared library:

    g++ -shared -o libshared.so [list of .o files]
The name of the library **must** have at all times the prefix `lib` and the suffix `.so`. The rest of it is the name of the library. This means that this `libgrovepicpp.so`  file name suggests that our library is called `grovepicpp`.

After we're done with it, we have to copy the shared library to the `grovepicpp_x.y.z/usr/lib` folder.


----------


### **Step 2**
Copy all the header files from the `source` folder to `grovepicpp_x.y.z/usr/include` (make sure you clean the `include` folder).


----------


### **Step 3**
Open `control` file from `grovepicpp_x.y.z/DEBIAN/` folder and modify the version accordingly.
Let's say we have a version like this: `0.2.1`:

 1. the first digit represents a major release: like a complete redesign or architecture. It's generally accepted that `0` as a "major release" actually means that the release it's yet to be completed. We'll have it this way as long as we don't have a versioning scheme in all of our repo(s)
 2. the second digit represents a new feature added to the current architectural scheme
 3. the third digit represents a bug-fix / a really small change / and so on.

Also, please modify all the other folders name according to the version number.


----------


### **Step 4**
Go at the directory level where you can see the 2 main folders: `grovepicpp_x.y.z` & `source`.
We need to create the actual package and and we'll type:

    dpkg-deb --build grovepicpp_x.y.z/



----------


### **Step 5**

`cd` out of that folder and archive the folder (with its all files) with the command:

    tar -csvf grovepicpp_x.y.z.tar.gz grovepicpp_x.y.z/




----------


### Voil√†! You now have a package ready to be delivered.

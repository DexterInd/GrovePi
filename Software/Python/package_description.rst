The GrovePi should no longer be installed with PIP. Instead, go with the following command:

.. code:: bash

  curl -kL dexterindustries.com/update_grovepi | bash

Or if you need to customize your installation, to be better suited for your requirements, check this GitHub `README <https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi/tree/master/Script>`_ for more information.

# USAGE
#
# Connect the dust sensor to Port D2 on the GrovePi. The dust sensor only works on that port
# The dust sensor takes 30 seconds to update the new values
#
# It returns the LPO time, the percentage (LPO time divided by total period, in this case being 30000 ms) 
# and the concentration in pcs/0.01cf

import time
import grovepi

print("Reading from the Grove Dust Sensor")

# default pin is 2 and default update period is 30000 ms
grovepi.dust_sensor_en()

time_to_run = 125 # 10 seconds
start = time.time() # current time in seconds
old_val = [0, 0.0, 0.0]

while start + time_to_run > time.time():

	# defaults to pin 2
	new_val = grovepi.dust_sensor_read()
	if old_val[0] != new_val[0]:
		print("LPO time = {:3d} | LPO% = {:5.2f} | pcs/0.01cf = {:6.1f}".format(*new_val))
		old_val = new_val

# and disable the interrupt on pin 2
grovepi.dust_sensor_dis()

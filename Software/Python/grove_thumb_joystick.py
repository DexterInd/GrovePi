# GrovePi Example for using the Grove Thumb Joystick (http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Thumb_Joystick)
#
# The GrovePi connects the Raspberry Pi and Grove sensors.  You can learn more about GrovePi here:  http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi

# Connect the Grove Thumb Joystick to analog port A0

# GrovePi Port A0 uses Arduino pins 0 and 1
# GrovePi Port A1 uses Arduino pins 1 and 2
# Don't plug anything into port A1 that uses pin 1
# Most Grove sensors only use 3 of their 4 pins, which is why the GrovePi shares Arduino pins between adjacent ports
# If the sensor has a pin definition SIG,NC,VCC,GND, the second (white) pin is not connected to anything

# If you wish to connect two joysticks, use ports A0 and A2 (skip A1)

# Uses two pins - one for the X axis and one for the Y axis
# This configuration means you are using port A0
xPin = 0
yPin = 1
grovepi.pinMode(xPin,"INPUT")
grovepi.pinMode(yPin,"INPUT")

# The Grove Thumb Joystick is an analog device that outputs analog signal ranging from 0 to 1023
# The X and Y axes are two ~10k potentiometers and a momentary push button which shorts the x axis

# My joystick produces slightly different results to the specifications found on the url above
# I've listed both here:

# USAGE
#
# Connect the Flow meter to Port 2 on the GrovePi. The flow meter only works on that port

# You can send 'run_in_bk=1' as a parameter, e.g. grovepi.flowRead(run_in_bk=1) to run the flow meter code in the background on the GrovePi. This allows you to use other functions such as digitalRead to run with the flow meter read running in the background
#
# the fist byte is 1 for a new value and 0 for old values
# second byte is flow rate in L/hour
#
# Since the flow meter uses interrupts, it is better to disable it once you are done using it
# The flow sensor readings are updated once every 2 seconds on the firmware
import time
import grovepi

import atexit
atexit.register(grovepi.flowDisable())

print("Reading from the Flow meter")
grovepi.flowEnable()
while True:
    try:
		[new_val,flow_val] = grovepi.flowRead()
		if new_val:
			print(flow_val)
		time.sleep(.5) 

    except IOError:
        print ("Error")

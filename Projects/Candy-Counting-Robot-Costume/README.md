## **Candy Counting Raspberry Pi Robot Costume**

In this project, we took the tried-and-true robot costume and gave it some life with the Raspberry Pi, GrovePi, and a handful of sensors.  The costume is a standard robot costume, but with a candy-counting machine attached that talks!

When a piece of candy is placed in the robot, it flashes it's LEDs, thanks the candy donor for the piece of candy, and announces the candy count.  We use the Raspberry Pi for brains, the GrovePi and assorted sensors to detect candy, and a battery powered speaker to do the talking.  The whole project takes about 2 hours to build.

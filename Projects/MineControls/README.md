Mine Controls are custom hardware controls for Minecraft and the Raspberry Pi!  In this project we show you how to build a custom controller for Minecraft using the Raspberry Pi and the GrovePi.  You can get [all the hardware for this project from the Dexter Industries website.](http://dexterindustries.com/grovepi)

Hardware Setup:
  Setup the GrovePi on the Raspberry Pi.
  Connect a touch Sensor to port A0.

Important! See the README file for important warnings.

eeprog reads and writes 24Cxx EEPROMs connected to I2C serial bus.

It uses the SMBus protocol used by most of the recent chipsets. Don't forget to load 
your i2c chipset and the i2c-dev drivers.

Use -16 switch for EEPROM larger then 24C16 (16 bit addressing mode). 

Again, it's really important that you read the README file.

Type "make" to compile.
